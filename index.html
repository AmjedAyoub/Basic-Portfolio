            My name is Amjed. I am a Full-stack web and application developer with a passion for creating smart, user-friendly and meaningful applications that make a long-term positive impact on the userâ€™s life. I believe that behind these few-inches-screen there is so much we can accomplish. It's facinating how technology can potentionally replace most human resouces but it would be almost imposible to replace a developer by a machine.

            I was born in Amman, Jordan. When I was 15 I moved for a school scholarship to Greece and lived there for 4 years. In 2016 I married my wife and moved to the United States; Seattle city and I love it here. I am an Uber/Lyft driver, and I have to say this job is amazing, I keep meeting new people and going to new places.
            <br><br>
            I enjoy watching documentaries - especially those are related to politics and history, gardening, and playing music!
